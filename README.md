# Playlist In Java
A simple application written in Java programming language. A song list is characterized by its name, a description that refers to the type of songs it contains, a list (dynamic data structure) of the songs it contains as well as the number of songs it contains. For each song you have to enter the title, the name of the artist (consider that there is only one), its duration in seconds and the name of the album.
The application should enable:
  - Show all songs of the playlist. For each song, all the saved information should be displayed.
  - Show all participating artists of the playlist. If the same artist participates in many songs he should only appear once.
  - Show all albums of the playlist.
  - Correction of the playlist items. It should be possible to correct any element of a song that is listed (eg album, artist, etc.). The selection of the song will be based on the title.
  - Search and view all the songs on the list performed by a specific artist.
  - Search and view all songs in the list contained in a specific album.
  - Delete a song from the list based on the title that the user will enter.
